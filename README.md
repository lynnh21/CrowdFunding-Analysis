# Excel Crowdfunding Analysis
```m
    Since 2007, Crowdfunding industry has quickly emerged as a valuable source for entrepreneurs to gain funding and exposure while other funds have become less available and accessible. This report will analyze the performance of crowdfunding over a ten-year period (from 2010 to 2020) to learn about the success of the funding based on specific categories.

    Key findings:
    Overall, entertainment sectors such as theatre, film &video and music had the most outstanding performance based on the number of successful projects. More than half of the total projects were successful with which theatre led the chart with 187 projects, followed by videos and music with 102 and 99 projects, respectively.

    However, 43.5% of the remaining projects were seen as unsuccessful and surprisingly, the theatre also took up the most failed projects with 132 plays 

    The only category that had no failed projects was journalism even though the number of projects was humble, with 4 projects in total.

    According to the third pivot chart, successful projects emerged significantly from May with 46 projects and reached their peak with 58 projects in July. However, the number dropped suddenly in the month of August and remained stable until the rest of the year.

    Conclusion: 
    Data showed the trend of funding projects in the entertainment field. Even though the chance of success was high, there remained a high risk of failure when investing in the same sectors.
